## Summary of how the robot seems to work.

It seems be able to run instead of run randomly walk around without picking up anything. It can follow the sequence when there are multiple cans next to each other. It can collect all of them. It is not hitting the wall much. It give a reasonable approach to handle the situation when they are no cans nearly by or less cans on the board, It kind of taking a bigger steps to walk around to seek for the cans. The graph also shows that over time the robot is able to perform better as the number of epochs goes up, it score of it is getting better.
